About the Resource-Based Economy.

Quoted from wikipedia: "A Resource-Based Economy (also known as post-scarcity or postscarcity) is a form of economy or society,
in which things such as goods, services and information are free. This is due to an abundance of fundamental resources (matter,
energy and intelligence), in conjunction with sophisticated automated systems capable of converting raw materials into finished
goods, allowing manufacturing to be as easy as duplicating software."

We do indeed currently have all the technology required to implement this. It is only the use of our current monetary system that
prevents this from happening as fast as it could by creating a sense of false scarcity of most resources.

This is where this portal comes into play. To bridge the gap by providing a parallel system.

About this portal.

This platform will serve as a hub to request resources, make available resources, manage transport, etc. The intent is to provide
a fully operational RBE implementation that can function in parallel with our current monetary system. Anyone will be able to either
provide a resource/transportation themselves or sponsor (pay for) a resource/transportation.
